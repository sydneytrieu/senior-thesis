# Images

This folder contains the images of data visualizations generated from the `notebooks` directory. Each file is named by the type of plot(s), a brief description, and the year(s) of budget data depicted. The plot type key is follows:

| Abbreviation | Plot Type |
| ----- | ----- |
| `bar` | Bar chart | 
| `bp` | Boxplot | 
| `hist` | Histogram |

Note that the year refers to the start of the budget year -- e.g. `2019` refers to the 2019-2020 budget year.
