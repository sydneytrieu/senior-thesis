# Data

This folder contains the data used for this project. 

The `original` folder contains the files listed on the [ASUC Financial Disclosure](https://asuc.org/financial-disclosure/) webpage. Spreadsheets hosted on Google Docs were downloaded as _.xlsx_ files, and PDFs were downloaded as is.


The `reformatted` folder contains the datasets, with special formatting and aggregated sub-totals / totals manually removed, separated by year. The records for 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016 were converted from _.pdf_ to _.xlsx_ files using [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/pdf-to-xlsx/). Each file was then saved in _.txt_ format to more easily import to Jupyter Notebook.
