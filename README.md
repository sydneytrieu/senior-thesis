# Black boxes and unreliable narrators: How the ASUC funds student organizations
Advised by Deirdre Mulligan, Professor at the School of Information.

## About

The Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) is an independent, nonprofit student government at the University of California, Berkeley. In addition to supporting the student body through advocacy and event programming, the ASUC is in charge of allocating funding for both its internal expenditures and student clubs – known as Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) – on campus. With a yearly budget ranging from $1.6 to nearly $2 million, the ASUC’s Annual Budget and Spaces Allocation (ABSA) process plays a significant role in shaping RSO activities. 

Through this project, I aim to explore the definitions of fairness as well as the relationships between the ASUC and RSOs within the context of the ABSA process. A bulk of the technical work conducted will center around the exploratory data analysis of ASUC’s budget data in order to identify trends and inconsistencies in the allocations.
