# How the ASUC funds student organizations
Advised by Deirdre Mulligan, Professor at the School of Information.

## About

The Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) is an independent, nonprofit student government at the University of California, Berkeley. In addition to supporting the student body through advocacy and event programming, the ASUC is in charge of allocating funding for both its internal expenditures and student clubs – known as Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) – on campus. With a yearly budget ranging from $1.6 to nearly $2 million, the ASUC’s Annual Budget and Spaces Allocation (ABSA) process plays a significant role in shaping RSO activities. 

Through this project, I aim to define what equitable resource allocation entails and the role technology plays in both upholding and subverting this process. A bulk of the technical work conducted will center around exploratory data analysis. The goal is to use the ASUC’s budget data to identify trends and inconsistencies in the allocations through visualizations, k-means clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, CCA, and t-SNE. Ideally, I would also juxtapose the allocations made before the algorithm was implemented with the allocations made after, as well as build my own prediction model to compare its results with the ASUC's. This work would help identify particular case studies on RSO financial situations for further examination.
